# Portal

## Summary

The Portal subsystem is how a WordPress site learns the full shape of a product family: what tiers exist, what features are available at each tier, and how to acquire or install those features. Where Licensing tells the site "what does this key cover?", the Portal catalog tells the site "what does this product offer?"

The catalog data comes from the Commerce Portal API. It is not license-specific. It describes the complete product catalog regardless of what a particular key is entitled to. The intersection of catalog data and licensing data is what determines what a site can actually use.

> **Development status.** The catalog structure described here represents the data we have identified that we need, not a finalized contract. The actual field names, tier slugs, tier names, and response shape are still being negotiated with the Portal team. Fixture data in `tests/_data/catalog.json` is a working prototype, not a spec.

## What the Catalog Contains

### Products

The catalog is organized by product. Kadence, GiveWP, LearnDash, and The Events Calendar are each a product. A product encompasses many features (plugins and themes) that customers can enable based on their tier.

Each product has an entry plugin that bootstraps Harbor on the site (see [Products and Entry Plugins](../harbor.md#products-and-entry-plugins)), but the product itself is the umbrella under which all of its features, tiers, and licensing live. A product catalog contains two things: tiers and features.

The product's own entry plugin is also returned as a feature within its catalog. For example, the `kadence` product includes a `kadence` feature of type `theme` representing Kadence itself. This means the update and feature management pipelines treat the product the same as any other feature — there is no special case for "the product itself" versus "add-on features."

### Tiers

Each product defines an ordered set of tiers that represent subscription levels. Tiers are ranked, and a higher rank means a higher tier with more entitlements.

| Field          | Type     | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slug`         | string   | Unique identifier within the product (e.g., `kadence-basic`, `kadence-pro`) |
| `name`         | string   | Display name (e.g., "Basic", "Pro", "Agency")                               |
| `rank`         | int      | Numeric ordering value. Higher rank = higher tier                           |
| `price`        | int      | Price in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)                           |
| `currency`     | string   | Currency code (e.g., `USD`)                                                 |
| `features`     | string[] | Marketing feature strings for this tier                                     |
| `herald_slugs` | string[] | Herald slugs associated with this tier                                      |
| `purchase_url` | string   | Checkout URL to buy this tier; upgrades use a portal change-plan URL        |

Tiers are always sorted by rank. This ordering drives feature availability. A feature that requires `kadence-pro` (rank 2) is available to anyone on `kadence-pro` or `kadence-agency` (rank 3), but not to someone on `kadence-basic` (rank 1).

Products that have free offerings include a free tier at rank 0 (e.g., `kadence-free`). The free tier is the entry point to the tier hierarchy. Features gated at the free tier are available without a license key — an unlicensed user resolves to rank 0, and `0 >= 0` satisfies the availability check. The `purchase_url` on the free tier points to the first paid tier, providing the upgrade path.

A product's tiers are its own. Tier slugs are namespaced to the product (`kadence-basic`, `give-basic`) so there's no collision across product families.

### Features

Features are the individual plugins and themes that make up a product family. Each feature belongs to one product and has a minimum tier requirement.

| Field               | Type           | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slug`              | string         | Unique identifier (e.g., `kad-blocks-pro`, `ld-propanel`)                                                     |
| `kind`              | string         | One of `plugin` or `theme`                                                                                    |
| `minimum_tier`      | string         | Tier slug required to access this feature                                                                     |
| `plugin_file`       | string\|null   | Plugin file path relative to plugins dir (e.g., `kadence-blocks-pro/kadence-blocks-pro.php`). Null for themes |
| `wporg_slug`        | string\|null   | WordPress.org slug for `plugins_api()`. Non-null means the feature is on WordPress.org                        |
| `version`           | string\|null   | Latest available version from the Commerce Portal                                                             |
| `release_date`      | string\|null   | Release date of the latest version (ISO 8601)                                                                 |
| `changelog`         | string\|null   | Changelog HTML for the latest version, consistent with `plugins_api()` sections                               |
| `name`              | string         | Display name                                                                                                  |
| `description`       | string         | Short description of what the feature does                                                                    |
| `category`          | string         | Grouping category (e.g., `blocks`, `theme`, `security`, `woocommerce`)                                        |
| `authors`           | string[]\|null | Product/author names. Null if not applicable.                                                                 |
| `documentation_url` | string         | Link to the feature's documentation                                                                           |
| `homepage`          | string\|null   | URL to the feature's homepage                                                                                 |

#### Feature Types

Features come in two types, each representing a different kind of deliverable:

**`plugin`**: an installable WordPress plugin. Has a `plugin_file` (plugin file path) and either a Herald download URL (built at runtime for exclusive features) or is available on WordPress.org (`wporg_slug` is non-null). These are features that need to be downloaded, installed, and activated.

**`theme`**: an installable WordPress theme. The `slug` doubles as the theme stylesheet (directory name). Has either a Herald download URL (built at runtime for exclusive features) or is available on WordPress.org (`wporg_slug` is non-null).

#### Tier Gating

Every feature declares a `minimum_tier`. This is the lowest tier slug at which the feature becomes available. Because tiers are ranked, a feature available at `kadence-pro` (rank 2) is also available at `kadence-agency` (rank 3).

The catalog defines what tier a feature requires. Licensing defines what tier the customer is on. The intersection determines availability.

## Caching and Data Access

### Catalog Repository

The `Catalog_Repository` wraps the portal client with option-backed caching. The cache persists until explicitly invalidated. It is cleared automatically when the unified license key changes (`lw-harbor/unified_license_key_changed`), and can be force-refreshed via `refresh()`.

```
Catalog_Repository::get()
├─ check option cache
├─ if hit → return cached Catalog_Collection
├─ if miss → Portal_Client::get_catalog()
├─ cache result (success or error, persisted)
└─ return Catalog_Collection|WP_Error
```

`refresh()` explicitly clears the cache and re-fetches. This is used when stale data needs to be invalidated immediately.

Both successful responses and errors are cached. An API error is stored to avoid hammering the API on repeated failures. The error throttle resets automatically on the next successful fetch.

### Collections

The portal subsystem uses two typed collection classes:

**`Catalog_Collection`** holds `Product_Catalog` objects, keyed by product slug. This is what the repository returns. Lookups are by slug: `$collection->get('kadence')` returns the Kadence product catalog or `null`.

**`Tier_Collection`** holds `Catalog_Tier` objects within a product, keyed by tier slug. Tiers are automatically sorted by rank on construction.

Both collections prevent duplicate keys. Adding an item with an existing key returns the existing item without overwriting.

## Naming Conventions

Class names in this subsystem follow a two-layer split:

- **`Portal_*`** names belong to the transport layer — classes that represent the external service boundary (`Portal_Client`, `Http_Client`, `Fixture_Client`). Named for where the data comes from.
- **`Catalog_*`** names belong to the data layer — classes that represent or store catalog data (`Catalog_Repository`, `Catalog_Collection`, `Catalog_Feature`, `Catalog_Tier`). Named for what the data is.

## API Client

The `Portal_Client` contract defines the integration with the Commerce Portal API. Currently it exposes a single operation:

- **`get_catalog(): Catalog_Collection|WP_Error`**: fetch the full product catalog.

Unlike the licensing client, this is not parameterized by key or domain. The catalog describes the full product universe. It is the same regardless of who is asking.

The `Portal_Client` interface is designed to accommodate future portal integrations beyond the catalog. Additional methods may be added as the portal exposes new data.

The production implementation is `Clients\Http_Client`, which uses the same PSR-18 HTTP infrastructure as the licensing client (see [Licensing: HTTP Infrastructure](licensing.md#http-infrastructure)). The base URL comes from `Config::get_portal_base_url()`.
During development, the `Clients\Fixture_Client` is wired in. It reads a single JSON fixture file (`tests/_data/catalog.json`) containing all products.
Tests use a fixture PSR-18 client that serves local JSON from `tests/_data/catalog/`.

## Error Codes

| Code                                  | Constant            | Meaning                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `lw-harbor-catalog-product-not-found` | `PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND` | Requested product slug not in the catalog |
| `lw-harbor-catalog-invalid-response`  | `INVALID_RESPONSE`  | API response couldn't be parsed           |

## Catalog Shape

The fixture data illustrates the structure. Each product in the current catalog follows a common pattern:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Product["Product: kadence"]

    Product --> Tiers
    Product --> Features["Features (33)"]

    subgraph Tiers
        T0["kadence-free\nrank 0, Free\npurchase_url → kadence-basic"]
        T1["kadence-basic\nrank 1, Basic"]
        T2["kadence-pro\nrank 2, Pro"]
        T3["kadence-agency\nrank 3, Agency"]
    end

    subgraph Features["Features (33)"]
        F1["kad-blocks\nplugin, min: kadence-free\ndot-org"]
        F2["kadence\ntheme, min: kadence-free\ndot-org"]
        F3["kad-blocks-pro\nplugin, min: kadence-basic\nexclusive"]
        F4["kad-shop-kit\nplugin, min: kadence-pro\nexclusive"]
        F5["kad-pattern-hub\nplugin, min: kadence-basic"]
        F6["..."]
    end
```

Note that `kadence` appears as both the product and as a feature within it. This is intentional — the product's entry point flows through the same update and feature management pipelines as any other feature.

The current fixture covers four product families:

| Product               | Tiers                        | Features | Categories                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kadence`             | 4 (Free, Basic, Pro, Agency) | 33       | theme, blocks, design, woocommerce, forms, social, content, security, management, performance |
| `learndash`           | 3 (Basic, Pro, Agency)       | 8        | core, membership, reporting, import, community                                                |
| `give`                | 4 (Free, Basic, Pro, Agency) | 28       | core, forms, gateway, email, reporting, marketing, integration                                |
| `the-events-calendar` | 4 (Free, Basic, Pro, Agency) | 9        | core, ticketing, community, integration                                                       |

## Relationship to Licensing and Features

### What the Portal Provides to Feature Resolution

The portal catalog is one of two inputs to the [Features](features.md) layer. It contributes:

1. **The feature definitions**, meaning every feature that exists within a product, with its type, minimum tier, installation metadata, and display information.
2. **The tier hierarchy**, the ranked set of tiers that determines which features a given tier unlocks. The `Resolve_Feature_Collection` class looks up each feature's `minimum_tier` in the product's tier collection to get its rank, then compares against the customer's tier rank from [Licensing](licensing.md).

### Tier Slugs

Tier slugs are product-prefixed (`kadence-pro`, `give-basic`) and are consistent between the catalog and licensing responses. This means a tier value from a licensing `Product_Entry` can be looked up directly in the catalog's `Tier_Collection` without transformation.

### Feature Type Mapping

The catalog uses delivery-oriented kind names (`plugin`, `theme`). The Features subsystem maps these to its own type hierarchy during resolution:

| Catalog kind | Feature class | Meaning                      |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `plugin`     | `Plugin`      | Installable WordPress plugin |
| `theme`      | `Theme`       | Installable WordPress theme  |

### What the Portal Does Not Know

The catalog describes what exists. It does not know:

| Question                                     | Answer comes from                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| What tier is the customer on?                | [Licensing](licensing.md)                                 |
| Is this key valid?                           | [Licensing](licensing.md)                                 |
| Is a feature available to this customer?     | [Features](features.md) (joins catalog + licensing)       |
| Is a feature currently enabled on this site? | [Features](features.md) (checks local state)              |
| What version is installed on this site?      | [Features](features.md) (reads from disk via Installable) |

The catalog is the menu. Licensing is the receipt. Feature resolution is the waiter who checks both before serving.

## Download URL Builder

Download URLs for exclusive (non-WordPress.org) features are not stored in the catalog response. They are built at runtime by an implementation of the `Download_Url_Builder` contract (`Portal\Contracts\Download_Url_Builder`). The contract is intentionally minimal — a single `build( string $slug ): string` method — so the download backend can be swapped without touching consumers.

The default implementation is `Herald_Url_Builder`, which produces one of two URL formats depending on which license type covers the requested slug:

```
Unified:  {herald_base_url}/download/{slug}/latest/{license_key}/zip?site={domain}
Legacy:   {herald_base_url}/legacy/download?plugin={slug}&key={legacy_key}&site={domain}
```

`Herald_Url_Builder` reads three inputs: the Unified license key via `Licensing\Repositories\License_Repository`, the active legacy license (if any) by slug via `Legacy\License_Repository::find()`, and the site domain from `Site\Data`.

**Precedence.** An active legacy license whose `slug` matches the requested feature wins over a stored Unified key. This is intentional and deliberately inverts the order used during feature resolution (see [Features: Resolution](features.md#resolution), where Unified is the primary and Legacy is the fallback grant).

The two orders answer different questions:

- *Resolution* asks "should this feature be shown as available at all?" Either source of entitlement is sufficient, and Unified is checked first because it is the canonical, modern source.
- *URL building* asks "which key should authenticate the actual ZIP fetch?" Legacy keys are scoped to a specific slug via their `slug` field, so when a matching legacy entry exists, Harbor knows Herald will accept that key for that slug. The Unified key only authenticates features inside its `capabilities` array, and the URL builder does not consult licensing state to find out which features that includes. Preferring legacy when present therefore avoids generating Unified URLs that Herald would reject in mixed-entitlement scenarios (for example, a customer on a Unified tier that does not include a legacy add-on they still hold).

A legacy entry only takes precedence when its `is_active` flag is `true` and its `key` is non-empty. Otherwise the builder falls back to the Unified URL.

`build()` returns an empty string when the domain is empty, or when neither a matching active legacy key nor a Unified key is available. The Herald base URL defaults to `https://herald.stellarwp.com` and is configurable via `Config::set_herald_base_url()`.

The Portal `Provider` binds `Download_Url_Builder` to `Herald_Url_Builder` in the container. To swap implementations (for example, to point at a different download service or to inject a test double), register a different binding for `Download_Url_Builder::class`.

`Resolve_Update_Data` depends on the contract and passes the resolved instance into `Plugin::get_update_data()` and `Theme::get_update_data()`, which call `build()` internally to populate the `package` field.

## What the Portal Does Not Do

- **Know about license keys**: the catalog is not parameterized by key. It describes what exists, not what a customer owns.
- **Track activation state**: whether a feature is installed or active on a site is not a portal concern.
- **Change based on customer**: every site sees the same catalog. Personalization happens by combining catalog data with licensing data.
