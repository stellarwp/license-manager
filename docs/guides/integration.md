# Harbor Integration Guide

This document explains how to integrate a WordPress plugin with LiquidWeb Harbor for unified license management.

---

## Notes on examples

Since the recommendation is to use [Strauss](https://github.com/BrianHenryIE/strauss) to prefix this library's namespaces, all examples use the `Boomshakalaka` namespace prefix. Replace `Boomshakalaka` with your actual vendor prefix wherever it appears.

---

## 1. Initialization

Harbor must be initialized once per plugin, typically inside a service provider registered during the plugin bootstrap.

```php
use Boomshakalaka\LiquidWeb\Harbor\Config;
use Boomshakalaka\LiquidWeb\Harbor\Harbor;

// Announce this premium plugin to Harbor's bootstrap gate.
// This MUST run before Harbor::init(). See "The premium-plugin gate" below.
add_filter('lw_harbor/premium_plugin_exists', '__return_true');

class HarborServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        // Tell Harbor which plugin hosts this instance.
        // Use a plugin basename constant defined in your main plugin file,
        // e.g. define( 'MY_PLUGIN_BASENAME', plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) )
        Config::set_plugin_basename(MY_PLUGIN_BASENAME);

        // Give Harbor access to your DI container
        Config::set_container($container);

        // Boot all Harbor subsystems (only if the premium-plugin gate passes)
        Harbor::init();
    }

    public function boot(): void
    {
        // Register filters here (see sections below)
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

- `Config::set_plugin_basename()` must receive the plugin basename (e.g. `myplugin/myplugin.php`). Define a constant like `MY_PLUGIN_BASENAME` in your main plugin file using `plugin_basename( __FILE__ )` and pass that — calling `plugin_basename( __FILE__ )` from inside a service class will resolve the wrong file
- `Config::set_container()` must be called before `Harbor::init()`
- `Harbor::init()` sets up all internal providers (storage, API, licensing, admin UI, etc.), but only when the premium-plugin gate passes (see next section)
- Register the Harbor service provider after all other providers so the container is fully configured

### The premium-plugin gate

`Harbor::init()` only registers providers, REST routes, the admin page, and the `lw_harbor/loaded` action when at least one callback on the `lw_harbor/premium_plugin_exists` filter returns `true`. This keeps Harbor dormant on sites that have only free entry plugins installed.

**The filter must be attached before `Harbor::init()` is called.** Anywhere earlier in the request works; the simplest pattern is to attach it on the line right above the `Harbor::init()` call (as shown in the example above). If your plugin attaches the filter from a service class that itself is loaded inside `Harbor::init()`, it is too late: the gate has already been evaluated.

```php
add_filter('lw_harbor/premium_plugin_exists', '__return_true');
```

Use a real condition (e.g. a license check) instead of `__return_true` if you want the gate to remain closed when the premium plugin is installed but not licensed.

Once the gate passes, Harbor fires the `lw_harbor/loaded` action. Hook anything that depends on Harbor being fully booted (admin notices, submenu registrations, REST consumers) on this action rather than on `plugins_loaded` directly.

```php
add_action('lw_harbor/loaded', function () {
    // Safe to call lw_harbor_register_submenu(), query the leader, etc.
});
```

---

## 2. Bundling a License Key

Harbor discovers your plugin's embedded key automatically by scanning active plugins for a file named `LWSW_KEY.php` in the plugin root. No filter registration is required.

Create `LWSW_KEY.php` in your plugin root and have it return your `LWSW-`-prefixed key:

```php
<?php return 'LWSW-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx';
```

This file should be gitignored and injected at build or deploy time. Its presence signals to Harbor that your plugin belongs to the unified licensing system. Plugins managed by Uplink v2 do not ship this file.

When Harbor scans active plugins and finds this file, it reads the key and auto-stores it if no key is already present on the site. If a key is already stored, the stored key takes precedence.

---

## 3. Reporting Legacy Licenses

**Filter:** `lw-harbor/legacy_licenses`

If your plugin has a pre-existing license system (licenses stored in the database before Harbor), report those licenses to Harbor so they appear in the unified license UI.

```php
add_filter('lw-harbor/legacy_licenses', function (array $licenses): array {
    $storedLicenses = get_option('my_plugin_licenses', []);

    foreach ($storedLicenses as $license) {
        $licenses[] = [
            'key'        => $license['key'],         // The license key string
            'slug'       => $license['slug'],        // The product/add-on slug this key covers
            'name'       => $license['name'],        // Human-readable product name
            'product'    => 'your-product',          // Product brand slug
            'is_active'  => $license['is_active'],   // bool
            'page_url'   => admin_url('...'),        // Where the user can manage this license
            'expires_at' => $license['expires'],     // Optional: ISO date string e.g. "2026-01-01"
        ];
    }

    return $licenses;
});
```

**Legacy license array fields:**

| Field        | Required | Description                                       |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`        | Yes      | The license key string.                           |
| `slug`       | Yes      | The product/add-on slug this key applies to.      |
| `name`       | Yes      | Human-readable product name.                      |
| `product`    | Yes      | Product brand slug (e.g. `givewp`, `kadence`).    |
| `is_active`  | Yes      | Whether the license is currently active (`bool`). |
| `page_url`   | Yes      | Admin URL where the user can manage this license. |
| `expires_at` | No       | Expiry date string (e.g. `"2026-01-01"`).         |

> **Tip:** If a single license key covers multiple add-ons, emit one entry per add-on slug so each slug can display a legacy license badge on the Feature Manager page.

### How Harbor uses reported legacy keys

Beyond surfacing legacy entries in the unified license UI, Harbor wires the reported key into feature availability and updates:

1. **Availability.** An `is_active = true` entry marks the catalog feature matching its `slug` as available and in-tier, even when no unified license is installed (or when the installed unified tier does not include that feature).
2. **Updates.** Update checks proceed for matching slugs, and the package URL routes through Herald's `/legacy/download` endpoint using the reported key. Harbor does not depend on a legacy licensing server to validate or serve the download.
3. **Inactive entries.** An entry with `is_active = false` is treated as informational only. It surfaces in admin notices urging the user to renew or reactivate, but does not grant availability or updates.

**What `is_active` means.** Harbor takes this flag at face value from your plugin. It should reflect whatever your existing licensing system already considers a valid, in-good-standing license: for example, the result of a recent successful validation against your licensing server. Harbor does not (and cannot) independently verify the key; it trusts the reporting plugin to decide whether the customer is currently entitled to use the product. Regardless of the `is_active` value reported here, Herald validates the key server-side when serving the actual ZIP download, so a falsely-reported `is_active = true` cannot be used to obtain a package the customer is not entitled to.

**Malformed entries.** `key` and `slug` are both required (see the table above). Entries missing either field are not considered legacy licenses at all. They are dropped at repository intake and never appear in the UI, notices, availability checks, or download URLs. Only emit entries you have a real key for.

### Admin notices for inactive legacy licenses

Once you report licenses via this filter, Harbor automatically displays consolidated admin notices for any inactive licenses that are not already covered by a StellarWP v3 unified license. Notices are grouped by product, shown only to administrators, and are dismissible per user for 7 days.

Because Harbor handles this, you should remove or suppress any existing license-related admin notices in your own plugin to avoid showing duplicate warnings. The leader Harbor instance (the highest version on the site) is the one that renders the notices, so there is no risk of duplicates across plugins that all bundle Harbor.

### Notifying users on the legacy license page

If your plugin has its own license settings page, display a notice on that page to inform users that licensing has moved to Liquid Web's unified system:

```php
// With a product name (recommended)
lw_harbor_display_legacy_license_page_notice('GiveWP');

// Without a product name (generic fallback)
lw_harbor_display_legacy_license_page_notice();
```

This outputs a standard WordPress info notice:

> GiveWP iss now part of Liquid Web\'s software offerings. This page is still available for managing legacy licenses from your previous GiveWP account. If you purchased a new plan through Liquid Web, your products are managed through the Liquid Web Software Manager.

Call this function directly in the render callback for your legacy license page. Because it echoes immediately when called, no hook registration is needed — it renders wherever you place it.

## 4. Checking License Status

Use the global helper functions to check license state anywhere in your plugin. These functions always delegate to the highest-version Harbor instance present on the site, so they are safe to call even when multiple plugins bundle Harbor.

### Check if a product has an active license

```php
if (lw_harbor_is_product_license_active('your-plugin')) {
    // Plugin has an active unified license
}
```

This is the primary check for gating features or waiving platform fees.

### Check if a unified license key exists (local only, no remote call)

```php
if (lw_harbor_has_unified_license_key()) {
    // A unified key is stored locally
}
```

### Get the unified license key

```php
$key = lw_harbor_get_unified_license_key(); // string|null
```

### Get the licensed domain

```php
$domain = lw_harbor_get_licensed_domain(); // string
```

This returns the domain that Harbor uses for licensing on the current site (the host portion of the WordPress `siteurl`, lowercased). Useful when your plugin needs to display or transmit the licensed domain to an external service.

### Check feature availability

```php
// Feature is active locally on this site
if (lw_harbor_is_feature_enabled('feature-slug')) {
    // Feature is active
}

// Customer's license/tier includes this feature
if (lw_harbor_is_feature_available('feature-slug')) {
    // Feature is available under the current license
}
```

### Get the Feature Manager admin URL

```php
$url = lw_harbor_get_license_page_url(); // string (empty string if Harbor is not active)
```

---

## 5. Registering a Submenu Link

If your plugin has its own top-level admin menu, call `lw_harbor_register_submenu()` to append a **Licensing** item that links directly to the Harbor Feature Manager page. This lets users reach the unified license UI without leaving your plugin's menu area.

```php
add_action('lw_harbor/loaded', function () {
    lw_harbor_register_submenu('my-plugin-menu-slug');
});
```

`lw_harbor_register_submenu()` is a no-op until the `lw_harbor/loaded` action has fired, so hook the call into that action (or any later hook). The item is always appended last in the submenu so it does not disrupt your plugin's own menu order.

The function always delegates to the highest-version Harbor instance on the site, so it is safe to call even when multiple plugins bundle Harbor.

### Hiding the Settings menu item

By default, Harbor registers a **Liquid Web Products** entry under the WordPress **Settings** menu. If your plugin surfaces the Feature Manager through its own submenu link (above) and you do not want the standalone Settings entry, hook the `lw-harbor/hide_menu_item` filter:

```php
add_filter('lw-harbor/hide_menu_item', '__return_true');
```

The Feature Manager page itself remains registered, so direct URLs continue to work. The filter hides both the standalone **Settings → Liquid Web Products** entry and any submenu items added through `lw_harbor_register_submenu()`.

## 6. Embedded / Bundled License Keys

See [Section 2](#2-bundling-a-license-key). Bundling a key is done entirely through `LWSW_KEY.php` — no additional wiring is needed.

### Filters

| Filter                            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lw_harbor/premium_plugin_exists` | Announce that a premium plugin is present so `Harbor::init()` registers its providers. Receives and returns `bool`. **Must be attached before `Harbor::init()` runs**; see [Initialization](#1-initialization). |
| `lw-harbor/legacy_licenses`       | Report pre-existing licenses to Harbor. Receives and returns `array $licenses`.                                                                                                                                 |
| `lw-harbor/hide_menu_item`        | Hide the **Liquid Web Products** Settings entry and any `lw_harbor_register_submenu()` items without unregistering the page itself.                                                                             |
