# Portal Endpoints

All endpoints require the `manage_options` capability.

See [Portal](../../subsystems/portal.md) for the product, tier, and feature data models and field definitions.

## GET /liquidweb/harbor/v1/catalog

Returns the full product portal. Each entry represents a product family with its tiers and features. The portal is not license-specific — it describes everything available regardless of entitlements.

### Response (200)
