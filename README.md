## Installation

It's recommended that you install Harbor as a project dependency via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require stellarwp/harbor
```

> We _actually_ recommend that this library gets included in your project using [Strauss](https://github.com/BrianHenryIE/strauss).
>
> Luckily, adding Strauss to your `composer.json` is only slightly more complicated than adding a typical dependency, so checkout our [strauss docs](https://github.com/stellarwp/global-docs/blob/main/docs/strauss-setup.md).

## Initialize the library

Initializing the Harbor library should be done within the `plugins_loaded` action, preferably at priority `0`.

```php
use LiquidWeb\Harbor\Harbor;

add_action( 'plugins_loaded', function() {
 /**
  * Configure the container.
  *
  * The container must be compatible with stellarwp/container-contract.
  * See here: https://github.com/stellarwp/container-contract#usage.
  *
  * If you do not have a container, we recommend https://github.com/lucatume/di52
  * and the corresponding wrapper:
  * https://github.com/stellarwp/container-contract/blob/main/examples/di52/Container.php
  */
 $container = new Container();
 Config::set_container( $container );
 Harbor::init();
}, 0 );
```

## Translation

Package is using `__( 'Invalid request: nonce field is expired. Please try again.', '%TEXTDOMAIN%' )` function for translation. In order to change domain placeholder `'%TEXTDOMAIN%'` to your plugin translation domain run

```bash
./bin/stellar-harbor domain=<your-plugin-domain>
```

or

```bash
./bin/stellar-harbor
```

and prompt the plugin domain
You can also add lines below to your composer file in order to run command automatically

```json
"scripts": {
 "stellar-harbor": [
   "vendor/bin/stellar-harbor domain=<your-plugin-domain>"
 ],
 "post-install-cmd": [
   "@stellar-harbor"
 ],
 "post-update-cmd": [
   "@stellar-harbor"
 ]
  }
```

## Registering a plugin

Harbor discovers your plugin's embedded key automatically by scanning active plugins for a file named `LWSW_KEY.php` in the plugin root. No filter registration is required. See the [Harbor Integration Guide](/docs/harbor-integration-guide.md) for more details.

## Changelog

This project uses [@stellarwp/changelogger](https://github.com/stellarwp/changelogger) to manage its changelog. All notable changes are tracked via changelog entry files in the `changelog/` directory.

To add a new changelog entry:

```bash
bunx @stellarwp/changelogger add
```

To compile changelog entries into `changelog.txt`:

```bash
bunx @stellarwp/changelogger write --overwrite-version <version>
```
